# Superteam Germany's 3 Day Hackathon Bootcamp

Superteam Germany did a 3 day IRL hackathon bootcamp at w3.hub in Berlin from August 27-29. Goal was to support the participants for the upcoming Radar hackathon and kickstart their journey into Solana.

This repository contains code samples that were written during the sessions.

## Lessons

The lessons that contained live coding sessions were:
